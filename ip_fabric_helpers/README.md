#### IP Fabric Helper

Copy the files to their respective homes in the default directory on a workflow composer install.

The easiest way to do that is to clone this directory into `/opt/stackstorm/packs/` then copy each file into place with `cp`.

Reload stackstorm with `st2ctl reload --register-actions`.

These files will help you build an IP Fabric with minial hassle.

Enjoy.
